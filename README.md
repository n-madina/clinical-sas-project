# End-to-End Clinical SAS Programming: SDTM & ADaM Dataset Development
This project demonstrates an end-to-end clinical data workflow using SAS. It uses publicly available NSCLC oncology data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and simulates a sponsor-level clinical programming environment.

## Objectives
- Clean raw clinical datasets and standardize formats  
- Map data to CDISC-compliant SDTM domains (DM, DS, TU, etc.)  
- Create mock ADaM datasets for statistical analysis  
- Generate summary reports using ODS

## Key File
- `clinical_data_processing.sas` â€“ Main SAS program performing data import, cleaning, SDTM mapping, and output generation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- SAS data cleaning and transformation  
- CDISC SDTM mapping (DM, DS, TU)  
- Basic ADaM derivation  
- PROC SQL, DATA steps, and ODS reporting  
- Simulated sponsor workflow with traceable QC and documentation
